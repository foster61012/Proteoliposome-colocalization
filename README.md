# Proteoliposome colocalization
MATLAB code used to identify pairs of colocalized proteoliposomes from confocal microscopy images. Centroid identification is based on the MATLAB implementation of the Crocker and Grier particle tracking algorithm (http://site.physics.georgetown.edu/matlab/), which is a dependency for the code here and must be downloaded prior to use.
